I'm Jingyun, a postdoc majored in Genetics and Bioinformatics, from National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, China. I have trained with general biology during undergraduate study, including courses of genetics, molecular biology, biochemistry and biostatistics, and experienced in analysis of NGS data with programming skills like Perl and R during postgraduate. Within last three years, I have engaged in several research projects on QTL mapping, multi-omics analysis, genomic prediction and evolutionary topics.
