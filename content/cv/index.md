## RECENT RESEARCH FIELDS

* Population genomics and genetics, typically on the genetic architecture dissection of complex traits in maize and providing useful gene resources and knowledge for breeding
* NGS applications, majorly on applying whole genome re-sequencing & RNA-seq & metabolic technologies to explore the maize functional genome
* Evolutionary genomics, especially on plant evolution & adaptation & improvement
* Bio-data visualization & database construction

---

## SKILLS

* Bioinformatics
  * Programming Languages: mainly in `Perl`, `R` and `shell scripts`
  * NGS/omics-seq analyses: DNA/RNA-seq(Illumina, PB-SMRT/RSII, ONT), ChIP/HiC/WGS/ATAC, metabolic data(LC-MS,GC-MS) etc.
  * Downstream analyses: Population Genetics, Phylogenetics, Genomics, Epigenetics etc.
  * Visualisation: R/ggplot-x, AdobeIllustrator, Photoshop etc.
  * DIY pipelines when necessary: Variation calling, GWAS and post-GWAS etc.
  * Web development: more a designer than a developer, dealing with data more than code.
* Biological
  * Experimental techniques: Proficient in molecular cloning, molecular marker detection and screening and other molecular biology experimental techniques.
  * Three years of field planting and management experience.
